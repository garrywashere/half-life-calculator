# Half-Life Calculator
Graph data collected from a sample, then calculate the Half-Life, with the ability to store and recall past data. ⚛️

## Introduction
As part of my Physics course revision, I aim to implement an experiment in Python. While I recognize that similar outcomes can be achieved using spreadsheet software for a more streamlined experience, this side project serves as both a proof of concept and a test of my skills. :)

# Features
- Store and retrieve data from CSV files
- Plot graphs of activity against time
- Calculate the Half-Life of a material from provided data

# Aims
- Apply Physics knowledge
- Integrate machine learning through statistical mathematics

# To-Do
- Write data collection function
    - Live collection of data
    - Importing from CSV files
    - Saving to CSV files
    - Intuitive interface to collect data
- Write plotting function
    - Create scatter graph using matplotlib for activity against time
    - Numpy for polynomial regression - plotting it on the graph
- Interactive menus for manipulating stored data
    - Recall Half-Lives of previously added materials and data
    - Export tables into CSV so it may be imported in spreadsheet software
    - Export graphs as image files
